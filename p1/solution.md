### P1 Solution

a. In order to separate the screen into two regions, we can set the Line Compare Register to hold the horizontal scan line at which we wish to divide the screen along. When the VGA controller reaches that scan line, it sets the scan line back to 0, which effectively segmenents the screen into two regions. When setting up the status bar, we must make sure to set Pixel Panning Mode to 0 if we wish for the status bar to be completely static (i.e. non-scrolling). This can be set in bit 5 of the Attribuite Mode Control Register.

b. In order to change the VGA's color palette, the index of the palette we wish to change must be calculated, with VGA supporting up to 256 colors depending on the mode. To properly access the index we want to change, we must read the DAC State Register and the DAC Address Write Mode Register. In the case the we want to write, we must set the index calculated earlier to the DAC Address Write Mode Register, and then write the color values red, green, and blue to the DAC Data Register as three distinct bytes. Finally, we must restore either DAC Address Write Mode or DAC Address read mode depending on the intial DAC State register.
